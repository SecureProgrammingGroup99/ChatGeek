1) Open the ChatGeek folder in your terminal.
   - The backend folder contains the server that connects to the wider network.
   - The frontend folder contains the client that users run to access the system.
   - Note: NPM is used, you may need to install it.
2) Run "npm install"
3) Run "cd frontend"
4) Run "npm install --legacy-peer-deps"
5) Run "cd ../"
6) Follow the instructions in README.md in that folder.
7) You should now have the backend running.
8) Go to the frontend folder in a new terminal.
9) Run "npm start" (it will take a while).
10) It is now running on http://localhost:3000/

After signing in, you can message an individual user by first searching for them in the top left.

You can connect to http://localhost:3000/ via multiple private/incognito browser windows to simulate multiple clients.
